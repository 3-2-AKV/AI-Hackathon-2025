# AI-Hackathon-2025

## 🧠 AI Meal Planner App
A smart, interactive meal planner built with Streamlit, powered by AI recipe generation. This app helps you manage your fridge, shopping cart, and cookbook — all while making use of ingredients efficiently and reducing food waste.

It’s like having a calm sous-chef that doesn’t yell, doesn’t judge, and actually reads your preferences.

## 📦 Features
Ingredient Tracker: Add what you have at home and see when it expires.

Shopping Cart: Keep track of what to buy and quickly move it to your fridge.

AI Recipe Generator: Choose ingredients, define your preferences, and generate full recipes (title, ingredients, steps).

Cookbook: Save recipes you love, search by keywords or meal type, and view them anytime.

## 🚀 How to Use
#### 1. Ingredients Tab
Manage everything currently in your fridge:

Add a product with name, amount, unit, and expiration date.

Toggle to show expired products.

Delete items or select them for recipe generation using checkboxes.

#### 2. Shopping Cart Tab
Track your grocery list:

Add items you plan to buy.

Click Prepare to input quantity, unit, and expiry once purchased — and move them directly into your fridge list.

#### 3. Create Recipe Tab
Generate AI-based recipes using selected ingredients:

Check the boxes next to ingredients you want to use.

Set number of recipes, meal type, and any personal preferences (e.g. “no dairy”).

AI will return full recipes with title, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

#### 4. Cookbook Tab
Store and manage your favorite recipes:

View all recipes you've saved.

Search by name or filter by meal type.

Toggle “Show Recipe” to view details on the right.

Remove recipes with confirmation prompts.

## 🧠 Database Overview
The app uses SQLite with 3 tables:

ingredients
Tracks items in your fridge:

id, name, amount, unit, expiration_date

shopping_list
Tracks grocery items you plan to buy:

id, name

meal_plans
Stores AI-generated recipes:

id, meal_type, meal_name, ingredients, instructions, date

## ⚙️ Under the Hood (Code Overview)
Built with Streamlit (main.py)

UI is split into two columns:

Left → Tabs with interactive controls (fridge, cart, recipe builder)

Right → Recipe output & viewer

Ingredient and grocery lists are stored in st.session_state for persistent state across reruns.

Recipes are generated by an AI model (likely via generate_meal_plan()), and returned as JSON, parsed and rendered as full instructions.

Data is synced with the database on every add/remove to persist state across sessions.

Confirmation buttons (with Are you sure?) prevent accidental deletion.
